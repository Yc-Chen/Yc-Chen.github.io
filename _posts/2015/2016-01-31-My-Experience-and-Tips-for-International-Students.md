Being a Chinese student that never studied abroad before and found a job in The Netherlands after a two-year program, I believe I have experienced the biggest cultural difference and have successfully adapted to the local life, both socially and professionally. I tried a lot of things during my student life; there are some stuffs that I wish I have done and some stuffs that I don't have to care so much. I would like to share my experience and hope it can help others to overcome their challenges.

### 'Dutch people ended up talking to Dutch people'.
</Aggregation phenomena. Example: coursera 'Model Thinking' Ch #. Minor discrimination of single person creates enormous aggregation effect. Language aggregation effect. Examples. Don't take it personally. Foreigners get aggregation too. Examples lunch table. 
What to do: reach out; be tolerant to 'awkward' behaviors of yourself and of others. 
Do something you enjoy doing; find a hobby. Example sports. >

Language was the first thing I noticed when I landed in this country and it turned out to be the most fundamental thing. We thought it is no problem to only know Enlish in NL but it turned out not true. We all overlooked the fact that **Dutch is the native language here**. Not only does the Dutch language appear on newspapers and restaurant menus, but it makes the subtle difference in conversations between Dutch speaking and English speaking people. When the difference aggregates(which easily happens), it can be perceived as rude or even discrimination. I have heard foreingers complaining 'Dutch people always end up talking to Dutch people'. It can scare foreigners of making Dutch friends if they are not aware that it is merely **an aggregation effect**.

What is aggregation effect? It is described very well in the [Model Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking) on Coursera. The second topic [Aggregation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc-KW8EuFZw) used a model to describe the phenomenon that culturally tolerant people in US ended up living in the neighbourhood with the same cultural background. Does it sound familiar to foreingers complaining 'Dutch people ended up talking to Dutch people'? As the model reveals, a slight preference towards the native language, Dutch in this case, can lead to a huge aggregation effect that Dutch people end up talking Dutch. 

The key is not to take it personally. The cultural aggregation effect actually happens with everyone, including foreigners. I have seen people easily become friends if they are both Italians, Mexicans, Indians, etc. It is humanity and no one escapes from it. However bearing this in mind, I hope it becomes easier to recognize the situation and still feel comfortable when you don't understand anything in a Dutch conversation.

### How to make friends in a changing environment.
</How to deal with changes in the networking environment. >

### How to plan for your study and career.
</Study cost, immigration issue, Dutch language, internships/graduation project, keeping contacts with supervisors for PhD offers or other references. >

### How to make efficient use of free time. 
</Parties vs. volunteer work vs. freelancer vs. side job.>
