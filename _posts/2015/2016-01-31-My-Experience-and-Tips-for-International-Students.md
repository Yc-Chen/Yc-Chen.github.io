Being a Chinese student that never studied abroad before and found a job in The Netherlands after a two-year program, I believe I have experienced the biggest cultural difference and have successfully adapted to the local life, both socially and professionally. I tried a lot of things during my student life; there are some stuffs that I wish I have done and some stuffs that I don't have to care so much. I would like to share my experience and hope it can help others to overcome their challenges.

### 'Dutch people only like to talk to Dutch people'.
<!-- Aggregation phenomena. Example: coursera 'Model Thinking' Ch #. Minor discrimination of single person creates enormous aggregation effect. Language aggregation effect. Examples. Don't take it personally. Foreigners get aggregation too. Examples lunch table. 
What to do: reach out; be tolerant to 'awkward' behaviors of yourself and of others. 
Do something you enjoy doing; find a hobby. Example sports. -->

Language was the first thing I noticed when I landed in this country and it turned out to be the most fundamental thing. We thought it is no problem to only know Enlish in NL but it turned out not true. We all overlooked the fact that **Dutch is the native language here**. Not only does the Dutch language appear on newspapers and restaurant menus, but it makes the subtle difference in conversations between Dutch speaking and English speaking people. When the difference aggregates(which easily happens), it can be perceived as rude or even discrimination. I have heard foreingers complaining 'Dutch people always end up talking to Dutch people'. It can scare foreigners of making Dutch friends if they are not aware that it is merely **an aggregation effect**.

What is aggregation effect? It is described very well in the [Model Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking) on Coursera. The second topic [Aggregation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc-KW8EuFZw) used a model to describe the phenomenon that culturally tolerant people in US ended up living in the neighbourhood with the same cultural background. Does it sound familiar to foreingers complaining 'Dutch people ended up talking to Dutch people'? As the model reveals, a slight preference towards the native language, Dutch in this case, can lead to a huge aggregation effect that Dutch people end up talking Dutch. 

The key is not to take it personally. The cultural aggregation effect actually happens with everyone, including foreigners. I have seen people easily become friends if they are both Italians, Mexicans, Indians, etc. It is humanity and no one escapes from it. However bearing this in mind, I hope it becomes easier to recognize the situation and still feel comfortable when you don't understand anything in a Dutch conversation.

### How to make friends in a changing network environment.
<!-- How to deal with changes in the networking environment. -->
I didn't feel it difficult to make friends until I started working in a company and lost the daily social connection to the university. Gradually I stopped going to student drinks, being invited to weekend trips and, to make it worse, I got no response when I suggested a dinner. It felt like I was disconnected to the world; to be honest, it was quite depressing. The optimism would start the instruction: be open-minded, step out of your comfortzone and go out to make friends. In fact, I have tried, and no one responded to my open mind.

It took me a while to realize what happened. The biggest truth is that I'm in a changing network environment. The reason that I didn't have difficulties making friends is that in the university environment I was surrounded by people at the same age and, mostly, doing the same course. In the company environment I'm surrounded by people from different generations, different education background and from different projects. When people talk about international environment, they are overly optimistic that strangers can meet and communicate. They failed to realize that **while people from different cultures are put to study together, they DON'T form the bonds as strong as the same culture.** It needs more effort to bring the multi-cultural relationship to the same level compared to one culture. Unless the reward is higher than the effort, you cannot count on people being open-minded to make friends with you.

Now talking to my peers, I noticed this is happening with everyone. If he/she manages to keep good social connection, then it must be one of the following:

* They are surrounded by many people of the similar age.
* They are in a hobby group.
* They are locals.

Among which the first two can be general tips for internationals.

### How to plan for your study and career.
</Study cost, immigration issue, Dutch language, internships/graduation project, keeping contacts with supervisors for PhD offers or other references. >

### How to make efficient use of free time. 
</Parties vs. volunteer work vs. freelancer vs. side job.>

*This was shared as a speech on the [International Career Day](https://www.facebook.com/events/1459938794302655/) on September 9th, 2015. It was organized by The Hub Eindhoven and the Expat Spouse Initiative. I was invited through the TU Eindhoven Career Center to share my experience as an international students. This blog is written afterwards based on the outline of the speech.*
