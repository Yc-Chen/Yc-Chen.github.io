Although people have been talking about 3D printing for a while, I rarely see creative projects with 3D printing. People are obsessed with merely printing models. They are pretty and look twisted but after seeing hundreds of hobby projects like this, I get bored.

In this blog I will write down my understanding of 3D printing and what I think is possible to do as a hobby project. The source and inspirations are from a book that I finished recently and a conference I went. The book is called [Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing](https://books.google.nl/books/about/Fabricated.html?id=IuOGAQP0CD8C&redir_esc=y). The conference is called [3D Printing Electronics](http://www.3dprintingelectronicsconference.com/).

3D printing, in essence, is a new way of manufacturing. In the past it has always been well-educated human to make the mechanical design graph since it is a sophisticated work to decide which standard parts to use, such as, gears, belts, or leverages. Because you cannot manufacture at home so you have to depend on the standards. Now the 3D printing technology has significantly lowered the dependency on standard materials, and therefore makes it possible for the computer to generate the model.

As for what can be a hobby project with 3D printing, I put the following filters:

* The investment should be low, maximumally a home-use 3D printer.
* The scale should be small, for example, not to improve the material efficiency over the whole production chain.
* Only individuals are involved, no political or social parties, thus not trying a new business model or drafting new laws and regulations.

Here it goes:

1. Try the combination of 3D printed objects with other materials. For example you can think of using a candle, to explore interaction of the light from candles with the 3D printed objects. Not only as a candle holder, 3D prints can be projected to the wall, or maybe have some shadowing effect. You can also think about replacing candles with different color LEDs, creating an even more fantastic visual effect. You can also think of some post processing, like spraying with aceton and then warm up to create a smooth surface, or use laser cutter to add some surface patterns.

2. Try to implement other interactions to the 3D design software. A great 3D design software shall boost the use of 3D printers significantly. Till now most 3D design softwares use mouse and keyboard. Other kinds of interactions, such as hololens and Virtual Reality gloves. Even camera can be used for interacting 3D design softwares, one can first draw something on a paper, take a photo, and then put the photo to the 3D design software to generate a model.

3. Try to improve the 3D printing software. As the book said, one of the challenges to the consumer 3D printing industry is the software. Most time is spent on editing the models so that they can be accepted by the 3D printers. 3D model editing remains a big challenge. If you are familiar with 3D modeling and embedded systems, you can think of improving the 3D printing software to be more tolerant to errors.
