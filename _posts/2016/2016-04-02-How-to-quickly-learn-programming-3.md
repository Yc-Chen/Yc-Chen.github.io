description: It is never difficult to learn the syntax of a programming language. The real challenge is how to deal with the overwelmed information and find a good place to start. In this series of posts I'm trying to scetch an overview of programming; it consists 3 maps from the top level to the bottom level. Then for those who want to start to learn programming from scratch, it will become easier to know where to start and dive deeper. This series of posts is intended for people having at least a bachelor's or a master's degree so that there is some knowledge system established. It will be useful in learning programming.

### 3 - Small scale map, different programming languages styles
Now after the big map and the median map, in the small map I'm going to sketch the different styles of programming languages.

The programming languages are the models of decisions. Every programming language has some basic logic implemented, such as sequential statements, conditional statements, loops, case selector statements and wrappers. They largely represent how people make decisions. As mentioned in the big scale map, programming is actually a miniaturization of how people work together. In each level of programming it is a certain programming language to guide the machine to make decisions. However different languages do have different syntax. Some are indentation sensitive; some needs a ';' at the end of each line; some count from 0. When learning about any programming language, it is always more important to understand what decisions the program is trying to make, rather than the syntax.

On top of the programming languages, there are different programming styles. In the earlier days there was process-oriented programming. Now there are object-oriented programming and functional programming. Different styles of programming are related to how a big program is organized. The general goal is not to write the same code again, or as least as possible, and to make it easily understood by other people. With the drive of Moors' law, the computer power has been advancing continuously. So now people care less about the efficiency of the program, and more about the efficiency of writing the program. In some rare cases of embedded system engineering, machine performance can still be important, but not for people starting to learn programming.
