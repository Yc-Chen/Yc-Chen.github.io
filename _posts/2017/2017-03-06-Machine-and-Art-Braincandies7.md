Last year I gave a speech at BRAINCANDIES Session 7 on Machine and Art. [BRAINCANDIES](http://www.braincandi.es/about.html) is a platform for yummy bite-sized knowledge.

My powerpoint is shared from [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=E18B345AE584AA95!202&ithint=file%2cpptx&app=PowerPoint&authkey=!AErSf52dfKmNy6o).

My video is available at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmvnDNv0cro&feature=youtu.be).
